## What is this?

Caelestia-AW is a patch that adds **native animated/video wallpaper support** to Caelestia. It extends the wallpaper picker with a dedicated animated section, generates thumbnails for video files, and integrates fully with Caelestia's Material You dynamic color system.

This repo contains the installer, patcher, and uninstaller. The actual code lives in two companion repos:

| Repo                                                         | What it changes                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [caelestia-shell-aw](https://github.com/AdiAmbassador/caelestia-shell-aw) | QML: wallpaper picker UI, video rendering engine, thumbnail display, pausing logic. |
| [caelestia-cli-aw](https://github.com/AdiAmbassador/caelestia-cli-aw) | Python: video thumbnail generation, ffmpeg integration, Material You color extraction from video. |

------

## Features

- **Video wallpapers:** `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mkv`, `.gif` supported out of the box.
- **Separate animated picker:**  dedicated section in the launcher, no mixing with static wallpapers.
- **Video thumbnails:**  generated with the refresh button, cached by file hash, invalidated on file change.
- **Caelestia's Material You integration:**  dynamic color palette extracted from each video's representative frame.
- **Intelligent pausing:**  wallpaper pauses while on battery power or when a fullscreen app is active.
- **Real-time preview:**  scroll through the animated library and the wallpaper changes live.
- **Software decoding:**  consistent performance across all hardware, no driver dependency.

------

## Prerequisites

- Arch Linux 
- `yay` or `paru` AUR helper
- `fish` shell (required by the official Caelestia installer)
- `git`

------

## Installation

### Fresh install; Caelestia not yet installed

This installs vanilla Caelestia first, then applies the animated wallpaper patch on top.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caelestia-dots/caelestia.git ~/.local/share/caelestia
~/.local/share/caelestia/install.fish 
```



The next script clones my repo and installs the patches in place.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdiAmbassador/caelestia-aw.git ~/.local/share/caelestia-aw
~/.local/share/caelestia-aw/patch.sh 
```



### Existing Caelestia install; patch only

If you already have Caelestia installed and just want to add animated wallpaper support:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdiAmbassador/caelestia-aw.git ~/.local/share/caelestia-aw
~/.local/share/caelestia-aw/patch.sh 
```

------

The patch script will:

1. Copy the modified shell and CLI files into place.
2. Install the required dependencies (`qt6-multimedia`, `ffmpeg`, `python-pillow`)
3. Add a software decoding environment variable to your Hyprland config.
4. Restart Caelestia automatically.



## Usage

### Adding videos

Place your video files in:

```
~/Pictures/Wallpapers/Animated/
```

Supported formats: `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mkv`, `.gif`

### Generating thumbnails

Open the launcher (`Super, >wallpaper ` by default), switch to the **Animated** tab, and press **Refresh**. Thumbnails will be generated for any new videos. For large collections this may take a few seconds; this is intentional to avoid a permanent background service.

Thumbnails are cached at `~/.cache/caelestia/videothumbs/` and only regenerate when a video file is modified.



------



## Updating:

### Updating Caelestia-AW

To get the latest animated wallpaper patches:

```bash
cd caelestia-aw
```

Usually in:

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/caelestia-aw
```

And then:

```bash
git pull
bash patch.sh
```

This re-applies the patch on top of whatever version of Caelestia is currently supported.
Current v1.0 of Caelestia-AW patches Caelestia-2.0.2.

> **Note:** Updates to Caelestia-AW may be delayed from upstream Caelestia by a few or several days due to unforeseen compatibility issues. If you update vanilla Caelestia and something breaks, re-running `patch.sh` from the latest Caelestia-AW will resolve it.



### Updating vanilla Caelestia

If you update `caelestia-shell` or `caelestia-cli` via your AUR helper, the patch will be overwritten.

```bash
yay -Syu caelestia-shell caelestia-cli   # update upstream
bash patch.sh                             # re-apply AW patch
```

------



## Uninstalling

To revert to vanilla Caelestia:

```bash
bash uninstall.sh
```

This reinstalls the official `caelestia-shell` and `caelestia-cli` packages from AUR, removes the hardware decoding environment variable from your Hyprland config, and optionally clears the thumbnail cache. Your wallpaper library and Hyprland configuration are untouched.

------

## Known Limitations

- **Software decoding only:**  hardware acceleration (VAAPI, CUDA, Vulkan) is intentionally disabled for consistent cross-hardware behavior. On lower-end machines, high-resolution 4K wallpapers may impact performance.
- **Arch Linux only:**  the installer uses `pacman` and an AUR helper. Other distributions are not supported.
- **Upstream updates:**  updating `caelestia-shell` or `caelestia-cli` via your AUR helper will overwrite the patch. Re-run `patch.sh` after any upstream update. 

------

## Relationship to Upstream

This project is based on [Caelestia](https://github.com/caelestia-dots) by [soramane](https://github.com/soramane) and contributors. All credit for the original shell architecture, widgets, configuration system, installer, and overall project belongs to them.

Caelestia-AW exists because animated wallpapers are currently outside the scope of the upstream project. The goal is to maintain these features as a focused fork while staying as compatible with upstream as possible, and potentially contributing the work upstream once it matures.
